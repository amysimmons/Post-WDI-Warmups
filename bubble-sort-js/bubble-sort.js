// The bubble sort algorithm:
// Compare adjacent elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.

// Do this for each pair of adjacent elements, starting with the first two and ending 
// with the last two. At this point the last element should be the greatest. 

// Repeat the steps for all elements except the last one. 

// Continue for one less element each time, until there are no more pairs to compare.

// console.log('hello world');
